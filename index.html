                <h2>Bio</h2>

                <p>
                    My name's Chris. I'm currently a Customer Experience Designer (i know, right?) for Airangel Ltd. 
                    Airangel are propiators of a SaaS product that provides hotels, and hotel brands, with the means to manage their wireless networks and the subsequent guest experience. 
                    My role involves a hefty amount of product design; the writing of documentation supporting the product, updating the customer facing knowledge-base with how-to guides and training material and supporting the sales team with videos, slide decks and glossy sales material - basically anything that needs to look good! 
                    Oh, and I manage the website.
